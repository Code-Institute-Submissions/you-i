<h1><u> You&i Fitness</u> </h1>

<p>My first milestone project is a website for a studio gym that my sister owns.

The website has four pages in total. The first page provides a short introduction to my sister and the studio gym where she trains her clients. 
There is then a gallery page showing pictures of the gym and of Danielle with clients.
A contact page with a form allowing clients/potential customers to reach out and contact Danielle with any questions or enquiries about sessions.
The final page is a donwload page with a link to an example programme that is free to downlaod to anyone interested.
